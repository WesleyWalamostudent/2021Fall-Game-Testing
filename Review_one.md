## Summary

God of War 2018 is an action adventure RPG developed by Santa Monica Studio and is an amazing game about Kratos and his son Atreus that embark on a journey through norse mythology to reach the highest mountain peak. I don't want to spoil anything but just know that the story is an epic and emotional tail about family and the responsibility of godhood. In God of War the player will be in control of Kratos exploring diffrent realms to advance the story all the while Atreus follows you. There are 5 realms to explore in the game Midgard, Alfheim, Helheim, Niflheim, and Muspelheim each having you do quests for the narrative or side objectives for gear. I found the campaign to be enjoyable and did not get frustrated at any point with the game's story.
 
During my playthrough I found that exploration comes in the form of boat rides, climbing, items, or puzzles solving to advance in the story. 
One of the ways players will be traversing in the game is canoeing. The player will be using the canoe to traverse diffrent parts of Midgard, the main hub area of the game.
The game has big scope and players will need to clime in order to reach high places. Climbing is a great way to get to areas that I could not reach and is a nice change of pace. Puzzles come in the form of using the game's weapon the Leviathan axe. The axe is use to freeze gears from doors closing or destrying the enviorment for sequences to happen. Atreus is another method for puzzles solving and players will be using him to hoist up leges or crawl through small spaces. The boy can also destroy or activate the enviornment for players to move fowared. I loved exploration in this game and using these methos where fun and intuitive.

Gear and combat I found to be the game's main focuse. Throughout the game players will be encountering diffrent types of enemys and will have to fight in order to progress. The player's main weapon the Leviathan axe will be used in many diffrent ways to encounter foes. The axe can be used for light, heavy melee attacks and can also be thrown for range attacks. The axe can also be upgraded for diffrent moves and effects for example runic attacks that can give the player frost abilitys. Kratos himself can be upgraded through the skilltree giving him more moves. The skilltree has the Leviathan axe, shild, fists, and Spartan rage. Atreus also helps the player in battle using his bow for extra damage and can also be upgrated in the skilltree. Gear is another important feature in God of War. Gear helps the player level up to progress in the story and is a good way for players to explor. Throughout the game players will be acquiring body, wrist, and waist armor for diffrent perks and effects. I found the gear system to be very rewarding and worth my time. Every time I explor I get stronger and it incentives me to go out of my way to get better gear.  
 

## Final Thoughts

God of War overall is an excellent game I love the story it was very enjoyable giving me an epic and emotional tail. Exploration was a great factor in how I looked at my serounding and traversal. Gear was very well balanced and encourage exploration, I never felt too powerful or too weak with what I obtained during my playthrough. Combat was satisfying giving me diffrent ways of fighting and taking on foes with unique weapons and gear. What I did not like about the game was the menus and map. The menus are too small to read making it hard to understand the tutorial and the map looked like a painting with no clear direction. I also did not like many of the puzzels that were given because of the simplicity of them, giving me no real challenge to them. Other than that God of War is a game that I enjoyed from beginning to end.
