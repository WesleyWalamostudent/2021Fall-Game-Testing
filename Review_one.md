## Summary

God of War 2018 is an action adventure RPG developed by Santa Monica Studio and is an amazing game about Kratos and his son Atreus that embark on a journey through norse mythology to reach the highest mountain peak.
 I don't want to spoil anything but just know that the story is an epic and emotional tail about Kratos and Atreus learning about family and the responsibility of godhood.
 In God of War the player will be in control of Kratos exploring diffrent realms to advance the story all the while Atreus follows you.
 There are 5 realms to explore in the game Midgard, Alfheim, Helheim, Niflheim, and Muspelheim each having you do quests for the narrative or side objectives for gear.
 I found the campaign to be enjoyable and did not get frustrated at any point with the game.
