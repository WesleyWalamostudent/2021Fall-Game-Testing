During my many playthroughs I never had any issues with the games software that it was using making it also have good reliability. The game runs very smooth capping at a solid 60fps with some minor lag that the Ps4 can't handle. Ghost of Tsushima took 6 years in the making and the efficiency of the Ps4's hardware.
