## Ghost of Tsushima

Me and my team discuss about many diffrent quality games. The one that I picked is Ghost of Tsushima an open world samurai game. I picked this game because of the high quality standareds that it meets. The game has correctness because it functions on it's hardware the PlayStation 4 and runs excellent with no errors. During my many playthroughs I never had any issues with the games software that it was using making it also have good reliability. The game runs very smooth capping at a solid 60fps with some minor lag that the Ps4 can't handle. Ghost of Tsushima took 6 years in the making and the efficiency of the Ps4's hardware. Usability is very well done and is good for balanced difficulty. The game also is good with the Ps4, Ps4 pro, and the Ps5 having Interoperability.
