## Ghost of Tsushima

Me and my team discuss about many diffrent quality games. The one that I picked is Ghost of Tsushima an open world samurai game. I picked this game because of the high quality standareds that it meets. The game has correctness because it functions on it's hardware the PlayStation 4 and runs excellent with no errors. During my many playthroughs I never had any issues with the games software that it was using making it also have good reliability. The game runs very smooth capping at a solid 60fps with some minor lag that the Ps4 can't handle.
