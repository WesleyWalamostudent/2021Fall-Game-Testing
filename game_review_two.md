## Summary

Hades is a roguelike isometric game developed and published by Supergiant games. It is about Hadeâ€™s son Zagreus who wants to escape the underworld to get away from his father. The player will be playing as Zagreus to compel Dugans to escape from Hades. Along the way Zagreus will meet many of the Greek mythos on his journey to aid him. I love the plot of the game and many of the Greek myths that I meet with excellent voice acting. The narrative gets better as you play and never gets old.

Hades is a Duggen crawler with random generated rooms and enemies every time the player dies. During my playthrough I found myself a bit frustrated every time I died but gotten stronger with each death. Throughout the course of the game players will be acquiring newer and stronger weapons that can be upgraded if the played likes the item. I found myself purchasing new weapons that I believe were affective for the dungeons. Hades is also visually impressive with a comic book art style that pops. I like this style and it is very impressive in the game with character designs and environments.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I found Hades to be an excellent experience. I like the visuals with the cool weapons that can be upgraded and each challenge was a test for me. What I did not like was too much visual noise on screen. I found myself getting lost in all the action because of the flashy visual effects. But that did not stop me from having a good time.
