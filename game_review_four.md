## Summary

Doom 2016 is a first-person shooter action game developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks. Doom is about a demon slayer that must stop a demon portal from opening to earth from mars all the while you learn about the secrets of the UAC. The plot of the game is straightforward and is not that engaging but gets the job done. Players play as the Doom slayer a man that kills demons to protect earth from the underworld. The game is structured into chapters players will be exploring mars doing objectives to advance forward while earning new weapons and upgrades. I like my playthrough it was very thrilling and fun in the end. 

Doom 2016 uses the id Tech 6 game engine for its characters and environments that has a gothic style to it. Each chapter the player explores has a similar look to the environment such as deserts, since labs, and the underworld. I found myself not being interested in my surrounding because of the simplicity of the design. Not everything is bad though the animations are rock solid having a good and fluid feel to them. See my enemies move around the environment looks cool and is all the more satisfying when I take them out. I can see the engine at work when all these things are happening and was very stable during my playthrough. Menus are also cool looking having a futuristic vibe to them with a good and clear 3D map to follow.  

The meat of the game is the first-person shooting combat. At the start of the game players will start off with a small lazer gun but acquire new weapons through each chapter. There are 10 weapons in total and each weapon can be upgraded by finding weapon drones. Each gun packs a puch and stager enemies for a glory kill instantly killing the target. Every weapon dose relies on ammo though so the player must either kill or search for ammo. There are also other methods to kill enemies such as grenades, the chainsaw, and your fists adding more to the combat. Healing is acquired by finding green armor that fills up the players health by exploring. Health and ammo can be upgraded by finding and completing secret missions to better yourself. 

## Final Thoughts

Overall, DOOM 2016 was excellent with grate first person gameplay. I loved the combat shooting and the weapons that I get during my playthrough. The animations are great to witness adding more fun to my experience with each kill that I did. The sound in the game is also great too with each weapon sounding different. The environments are nice but lacks verity and exploration sometimes got confusing at points. Sold game from id Software and Bethesda that I played.
