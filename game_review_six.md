## Summary

Pokémon Unite is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena-based game developed by The Pokémon Company, TiMi Studios, and Tencent being published by Nintendo. Players go on Aeos island to do unite battles to gain Aeos energy for some reason that is never explained. The game is mostly about players face off against each other in 5 v 5 battle team. During these battle teams will have to work together to gain points before time runs out. The game is quite simple and I never found myself being frustrated on what I was supposed to do during battles. 

The game makes players create and customize their avatar before begging. I like the customization that the game gives me with options like skin color, hair, and eyes for my avatar. After customizing players are given different Pokémon to choose from before battling. You only start off with 5 but as players level up they gain more currency to gain Pokémon. Luckily during my playthrough I started with a Lucario and became my go to Pokémon. 

Pokémon Unite controls are simple use the touch screen to move and tap the attack icon for melee. Pokémon can also use special attacks for grate damage for quick points. During battles random Pokémon will be on the field for you to attack to gain unite points. Players will have to go to the goal for the whole team to have points. Once battles are over players get currency to either get Pokémon or costumes. 

## Final Thoughts

Overall, Pokémon Unite is a fun time to have. I like the simplistic gameplay and working with my team was well done. I liked the Pokémon I earned through the game and the cosmetics as well. The only negative thing I did not like was being overwhelmed by other teams when a player left the battle. It did not happen too often but became unfair. I also do not like the microtransactions spending real money just to get other collectables.
