## Summary

Uno is a card game made by Merle Robbins back in the 1971 and was a popular card game at the time. Merle Robbins made this card game to resolve an argument with his teacher about the rules of crazy eights. Uno is now owned by the compony Mattel that sells toys and board games. Now that app games have become popular in the market Uno has also become an app game. The app game Uno was developed by Gameloft Ubisoft Chengdu and published by Gameloft Ubisoft. Uno is a turn-based game where players must take turns getting rid of their cards until one player has one card left. 

The rules of the game Uno are simple players get 7 cards and each card has a number or symbol with a color. There are 4 colors Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow each having a number that go from 0 to 9. There are some cards that have symbol on them that allow the player to get credent advantages. Skip allows a player to skip there turn, reverse goes the opposite direction, or a wild card to place down for free. The app game Uno adds some other features in the game such as trading decks or giving other players cards. 

Uno has a little bit of luck base to it. The game has a randomizer system that gives players different cards. This is very fun it gives the game some pressure to the player not knowing what card they will get. Sometimes matches can get long because the game can give all players different advantages. When I was playing with my brother, we pulled a lot of reverses on each other until one of us had the right color. The randomizer is good and dose give me different card whenever it is my turn. 

## Final Thoughts

Overall, the app game Uno is an incredibly fun experience. It had me on the edge of my seat seeing if I could pull a fast one. The idea works and can give everyone a chance to win with the right cards. The randomizer is fair and give out different cards each turn for balance. I did not like playing alone the AI is too easy and can cheat at times making for quick matches. Other than that, it is free so have fun.
